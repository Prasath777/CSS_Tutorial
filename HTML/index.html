<p class="para-text">In 1998, Coldplay released their debut EP, Safety. The following year, the band released their debut single Brothers & Sisters and their second EP, The Blue Room. The latter was their first release under a major record label, Parlophone.[6] Coldplay achieved worldwide fame with the release of the song "Yellow" in 2000, followed in the same year by their debut album Parachutes, which was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The band's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), was released to critical acclaim.
     Their next record, X&Y, was the best-selling album worldwide of 2005; the Brian Eno-produced fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), was the best-selling album of that year and earned the band three Grammy Awards. In 2011, Coldplay released their fifth studio album, Mylo Xyloto, which topped the charts in over 34 countries and was the UK's best-selling rock album of 2011.[7] The band have since released Ghost Stories (2014), A Head Full of Dreams (2015), Everyday Life (2019) and Music of the Spheres (2021). 

<span class="italics">Viva la Vida</span> Coldplay have sold more than 100 million albums worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists.[8] They have won numerous awards throughout their career,
 including nine Brit Awards, seven MTV Video Music Awards, eight MTV Europe Music Awards and seven Grammy Awards from 36 nominations.[9][10] The band's first three albums — Parachutes (2000), A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), and X&Y (2005) — are among the best-selling albums in UK chart history.[11]
